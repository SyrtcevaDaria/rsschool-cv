The solution to this task is presented below:
```javascript
var whatTimeIsIt = function(angle) {
  let hour = Math.floor(angle/30);
  let ansHour = hour;
  if (hour===0){
     ansHour = 12;
  }
  ansHour = ansHour.toString();
  ansHour = ansHour.length < 2 ? '0' + ansHour : ansHour;
  let minut = angle-hour*30;
  let ansMin = Math.floor(minut/0.5);
  ansMin = ansMin.toString();
  ansMin = ansMin.length < 2 ? '0' + ansMin : ansMin;
  return ansHour+":"+ansMin;
}
